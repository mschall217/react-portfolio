                            <p>After studying oriented programming languages in college I turned my focus onto people and communication. I have rediscovered my love of programming and went back to school to fuel my passion for web design. I am a full stack developer with experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, third party APIâ€™s and more! </p>
                            <p>I have been obsessed with everything technology since high school when I built my first computer in a computer science class. I have now found a way to turn that hobby into a career through my Full-Stack Development certificate. </p>
                            <p>In my previous careers I developed expert level customer service skills. Some of my previous titles include flight attendant, supervisor, and account manager. I have a passion for working with and helping people. I thrive in a team environment where we are able to discuss and expand ideas. </p>
                            <p>I am currently seeking a role with a company where I can learn, grow, interact, and master my skills. I aspire to obtain a job as a Project Manager combining my new bootcamp skill set and expansive management background together</p>
